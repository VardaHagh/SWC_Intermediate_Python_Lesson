## # Intermediate Scientific Python\n",
This lesson assumes some programming background, but not necessarily with Python. It moves at a faster pace than a novice lesson, however.

We will learn how to do the following:

1. Reading and manipulating tabular data
2. Visualization and plotting
3. Modularization and documentation
4. Defensive programming
5. Writing command line scripts with Python
    
This lesson is based heavily on the [Software
Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/)
[``python-intermediate-mosquitoes``](https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-intermediate-mosquitoes)
lesson, and uses its datasets. It also includes some mixed-in components from
the
[``python-novice-inflammation``](https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-inflammation)
lesson.
